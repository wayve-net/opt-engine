The Requests team has decided to revert this feature as long term\n  maintenance of it is proving to be unsustainable in its current iteration.\n\n**Deprecations**\n- Added support for Python 3.14.\n- Dropped support for Python 3.8 following its end of support.\n\n2.32.4 (2025-06-10)\n-------------------\n\n**Security**\n- CVE-2024-47081 Fixed an issue where a maliciously crafted URL and trusted\n  environment will retrieve credentials for the wrong hostname/machine from a\n  netrc file.\n\n**Improvements**\n- Numerous documentation improvements\n\n**Deprecations**\n- Added support for pypy 3.11 for Linux and macOS.\n- Dropped support for pypy 3.9 following its end of support.\n\n\n2.32.3 (2024...", "output": {"operation": "Socket Programming", "steps": [{"step": 1, "action": "Create socket", "expected_time": "165ns", "resource": "CPU"}, {"step": 2, "action": "Bind address", "expected_time": "321ns", "resource": "CPU"}, {"step": 3, "action": "Listen for connection", "expected_time": "87ns", "resource": "I/O"}, {"step": 4, "action": "Accept connection", "expected_time": "386ns", "resource": "I/O"}, {"step": 5, "action": "Send/receive data", "expected_time": "345ns", "resource": "I/O"}]}}

There\u2019s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data \u2014 but nowadays, just use the `json` method!\n\nRequests is one of the most downloaded Python packages today, pulling in around `30M downloads / week`\u2014 according to GitHub, Requests is currently [depended upon](https://github.com/psf/requests/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS01NzA4OTExNg%3D%3D) by `1,000,000+` repositories.
